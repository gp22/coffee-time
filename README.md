# Coordinate a Coffee Meetup With Friends

## The purpose of this app is to learn how to implement OAuth user authentication into a full-stack app, and use API calls to get data for the app.

**The app allows anyone to:**

Search their local area to see all nearby coffee shops and how many people are going to each one.

**When you've authorized yourself to the app, it allows you to:**

Add yourself to a coffee shop to indicate you're going there.

Remove yourself from a coffee shop to indicate you're not going there anymore.

When you search your local area, and then login you should not have to search again.

The app will use the Yelp API to find venues in the cities people search for.
